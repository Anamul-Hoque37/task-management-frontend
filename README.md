# Task Management Application

## Short Description
This is a **Task Management Application** built with React, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks into three categories: **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between categories using the `@hello-pangea/dnd` library. The application also integrates with a backend to persist tasks in a MongoDB database.
